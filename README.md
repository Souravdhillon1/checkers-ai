# Checkers AI Game

## Overview
Checkers AI is a classic strategy board game, well-known and widely played across the world, especially in Japan. In this project, we’ve implemented an AI-powered version of the game using two well-known algorithms: **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**. This game supports two modes:

1. **Player vs Computer**: Play against the AI, which uses advanced decision-making algorithms to challenge you.
2. **Player vs Player**: Battle against a friend in a classic one-on-one format.

## Features
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI makes decisions by evaluating all possible moves and selecting the one with the best possible outcome.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: This optimization technique improves the performance of the Minimax algorithm by eliminating unnecessary branches in the decision tree.
- **Customizable Game Modes**: Choose between playing against the AI or against another player.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, intuitive UI to make your gameplay experience smooth.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
To run the game, you’ll need Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official site: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Additionally, the following libraries are required:

- `tkinter`: For the GUI interface.
- `random`: For AI decision-making randomness.

You can install the necessary libraries using pip (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install tkinter
```

### Running the Game
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/checkers-ai.git
cd checkers-ai
```

Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How It Works

### Minimax Algorithm
The **Minimax** algorithm simulates all possible moves the AI can make, considering both offensive and defensive strategies. It assigns a score to each move, where positive values represent favorable moves and negative values represent unfavorable ones. The AI aims to maximize its score while minimizing the opponent's score.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
**Alpha-Beta Pruning** is an optimization technique applied to the Minimax algorithm to cut down the number of nodes evaluated. It works by "pruning" branches of the game tree that will not lead to a better outcome than already explored branches. This significantly reduces the computation time.

### AI Strategy
The AI evaluates the current state of the board and decides its move based on both offensive and defensive factors. It prioritizes:
- **Attacking**: Capturing opponent pieces when possible.
- **Defending**: Positioning its pieces in a way that minimizes vulnerability and blocks the opponent’s moves.

### User Interface
The game interface is created using `tkinter` and provides a simple board layout. Users can interact with the game by clicking on pieces to make moves. The AI responds with its best possible move, and the game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
